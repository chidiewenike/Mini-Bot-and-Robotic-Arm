# Mini-Bot-and-Robotic-Arm
This project is simply to become familiar with controls using an infrared remote as well as a Bluetooth Playstation Analog Controller. I also plan to create a robotic arm with the use of servo motors to pick up & drop objects. I would like to add the arm to the mini bot to collect items for simple familiarity with robotics.
